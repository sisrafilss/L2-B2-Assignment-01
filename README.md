### There are many benefits to using TypeScript in JavaScript projects. A few of them are described below:

- TypeScript is statically typed, whereas JavaScript is dynamically typed. This means TypeScript checks types before runtime, helping to detect unexpected undefined errors.

- Using TypeScript in a large project helps detect type errors more efficiently. It ensures better code reliability and reduces debugging time.

- TypeScript improves code readability. In large projects with extensive codebases, understanding and maintaining the code can be challenging. TypeScript makes the code easier to read and understand compared to JavaScript.
